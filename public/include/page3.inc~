<h3 class="green">Performing</h3>
<p>
Whilst a student the interest in Baroque repertoire was kindled by membership of a small string ensemble specialising in this field, the Thomas Morley Chamber Orchestra, and in contemporary violin music as a result of visiting the USA. As part of his freelance performing activities he played in the London Philharmonic Orchestra. He also joined the New Cantata Orchestra of London, an ensemble specialising in eighteenth century and twentieth century repertoire, and became its leader.
</p>
<p>
An appointment to the Southampton Education Authority involved regular recital performances and guest appearances in the city and at Southampton University both in ensembles and as a soloist. During this period the formation of a student string orchestra led to concert appearances as a conductor and soloist/director, a role which developed rapidly after being invited to teach at Wells Cathedral School and train the school's Chamber Orchestra. Since then he has conducted the orchestra in concerts all
over the world, recorded for radio and television many times and made a commercial recording for Abbey Records.
</p>
<p>
In the 1977 Bath Festival he conducted the orchestra in the first performance of Geoffrey Burgon's Concerto for Strings and in 1984 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall the second London performance of Elizabeth Maconchy's Music for Strings which subsequently led to an apearance in an Arts Council film about the composer.
</p>
<p>
Regular invitations to direct string ensembles and give masterclasses are received from professional organisations; concerts resulting have included performances for the Guildhall School in London and for education departments in several centres around the country.

During this period an interest in the viola developed having commissioned an instrument from Malcolm Combes who had twice won the Facta Britannica Competition for luthiers with his instruments. Mark Knight was appointed Professor of Violin and Viola at the Guildhall School in 1976 as well as Head of Strings in the Junior Music Department, a post he had to relinquish to concentrate on the rapidly developing specialist scheme at Wells. In 1988 he rejoined the Junior Music Department when his teaching in the Senior School dictated a permanent move to London.
</p>
<p>
In 2002, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester invited him to give a public viola class which resulted in an appointment within the School of Strings.
 </p>

Pupils have won many awards and prizes, amongst them the Guildhall School's Millidge Prize and Gold Medal. In 1991 a pupil was offered a post-graduate place at the Moscow Conservatoire and in 2000 one of his long-term students, Lawrence Power, won the William Primrose International Viola competition.

<h3 class="green">Special Interests</h3>
<p>
Whilst a student Mark Knight began his long association with the Alexander Technique under the tutelage of the distinguished teacher Walter Carrington, himself a pupil of F. Mathias Alexander. All students are introduced to the technique's principles and encouraged to study with a teacher of the technique.
</p>
<p>
The interest in the historical development of string playing has let to active encouragement of students to take up original instrument performance and to train players of "modern" violin and viola to absorb the essentials of authentic performing practice. Several ex-pupils are professional performers with "period" ensembles.
</p>
<p>
Mark Knight has edited the 42 Etudes by Kreutzer for the London publisher Stainer and Bell, the latter a keystone volume of technical studies for all violinists, and for the same publisher some of Corelli's Violin Sonatas op.5. He has also transcribed Geoffrey Burgon's Six Studies for Solo 'Cello for the viola which is published by Chester and Co. London.
</p>
<p>
Mark Knight's fascination with the historical contexts of string playing led him to composition of cadenzas, first for Mozart's Violin Concertos No.1 in B flat and No. 2 in D and then viola concertos by Stamitz and Hoffmeister. Invitations then followed for cadenzas for Haydn's 'Cello Concerto in C and two of Mozart's Horn Concertos. The Haydn project grew to become a full transcription of the concerto for the viola.
